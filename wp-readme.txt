This is a Wordpress plugin that turns your 404 "page not found" error 
into a page devoted to helping find missing children.

== Description ==

The goal of this plugin is to make is *really* easy for someone on
Wordpress to implement the NotFound.org missing child page in
place of their standard 404 page.

The HTTP 404 is the error that you see when a link is broken,
or you navigated to web page that just isn't there. It happens,
and it's one of the most common error pages you see.

Why not turn that into something that benefits the world? The more
eyes that see a missing child, the more likely someone could be
found.

**Note**: Activating this plugin will automatically replace your
default Wordpress 404 page. To stop it, simply deactivate.

All of the missing child notices are served within an iframe
pointing to [NotFound.org](http://notfound.org).

== Notes ==

Because of the current width of the NotFound.org page (720px), it only
made sense to put it in a separate layout from your site, rather
then embed it in the current theme. If NotFound.org eventually
provides a more portable version, I'll accommodate that too.

== Installation ==

There aren't really any special instructions for installing this plug-in. Once
installed, be sure to go to the 'NotFound.org' settings page if you'd
like to do some basic customization.

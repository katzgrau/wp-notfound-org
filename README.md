# Instant NotFound.org 404 Page for Wordpress

A Wordpress plugin that makes implementing the missing child
404 page provided by [notfound.org](http://notfound.org) super easy, instead of futzing
with Apache or modifying your theme code.

## Something Interesting

At the time that I'm writing this, there are [something like ~57 million
Wordpress sites on the internet](http://en.wordpress.com/stats/).

According to [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/19/wordpress-now-powers-22-percent-of-new-active-websites-in-the-us/), Wordpress accounts for
nearly 17% of the internet's top one million most-trafficked sites.

If everyone installed this plugin, that would be a lot of eyeballs helping
find missing kids.

## Installing

Hopefully this plugin will be approved by Wordpress.org soon., so it'll go into
their repository.  Until then, you can always [grab the zip file](https://github.com/katzgrau/wp-notfound-org/zipball/master)
and upload it to your server.
